{"name":"ChemKinetics","tagline":"Fundamental chemical kinetics principles and analysis by computer simulation","body":"The ChemKinetics software is a chemical kinetics simulator and tutorial package that incorporates simple first-order irreversible, first-order reversible, first-order parallel, first-order consecutive, simple second-order and general second-order irreversible processes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Compiled Version\r\n\r\nWe have provided compiled versions of the application, one for Macintosh OSX and one for Windows systems. You will find it at: https://github.com/stephenbigger/ChemKinetics/releases\r\n\r\n### Source\r\n\r\nThe source code is available and can be compiled using LiveCode. A community edition of LiveCode is available at http://livecode.com/download/\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThe software is provided as a standalone application.  Versions exist that run on standard Macintosh OSX or Windows environments. The software should be run in conjunction with a standard spreadsheet program for the plotting and labelling of the processed output data.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Systems\r\nIt is anticipated the software will successfully run on a wide range of Macintosh and PC systems.  The following systems are examples of ones that have been successfully trialled:\r\n\r\n#### Macintosh\r\n* Mac OSX 10.6 or later\r\n* 1 GB RAM\r\n* Mac computer with an Intel processor \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n* Windows XP or later\r\n* 128 MB RAM or greater\r\n* 300 MHz processor or faster\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
