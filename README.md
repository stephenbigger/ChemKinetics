============

Fundamental chemical kinetics principles and analysis by computer simulation

## Abstract

The ChemKinetics software is a chemical kinetics simulator and tutorial package that incorporates simple first-order irreversible, first-order reversible, first-order parallel, first-order consecutive, simple second-order and general second-order irreversible processes.

## Requirements
The software is provided as a standalone application.  Versions exist that run on standard Macintosh OSX or Windows environments. The software should be run in conjunction with a standard spreadsheet program for the plotting and labelling of the processed output data.

### Recommended Systems
It is anticipated the software will successfully run on a wide range of Macintosh and PC systems.  The following systems are examples of ones that have been successfully trialled:

#### Macintosh
* Mac OSX 10.6 or later
* 1 GB RAM
* Mac computer with an Intel processor 

#### Windows
* Windows XP or later
* 128 MB RAM or greater
* 300 MHz processor or faster

## Installation

### Compiled Version

We have provided compiled versions of the application, one for Macintosh OSX and one for Windows systems. You will find it at: https://github.com/stephenbigger/ChemKinetics/releases

### Source

The source code is available and can be compiled using LiveCode. A community edition of LiveCode is available at http://livecode.com/download/
